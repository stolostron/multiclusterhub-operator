          Restore is an ACM resource that you can use to restore resources from a cluster backup to a target cluster.
          The restore resource has properties that you can use to restore only passive data or to restore managed cluster
          activation resources.
          Additionally, it has a property that you can use to periodically check for new backups and automatically restore
          them on the target cluster.
